# SQL_project
SQL project made with PostgreSQL database  
Has two tables, ufo sights and Australia weather  
Scripts get data from ufo (oldest sight and recent sights) and  
Joins two tables to check if it was raining in Australia  
When there was an ufo sight outside USA (because USA had so many, who would have guessed).
There is also data cleaning script to check for duplicate lines.
